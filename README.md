Never miss your online classes and attendance again!

As we all know, educational institutions have started turning towards online classes, by conducting scheduled Zoom (or WebEx, etc.) meetings due to the COVID-19 lockdown.
The teachers conducting the meetings might have strict joining rules enforced (for eg. not allowing students to join more than 10min late for class, etc.).
As students, every one of us might not be able to join on the dot for each class as we might have other work also to do, since we're at home and not in our schools/colleges.
This leads to an inadvertent delay on our side, causing us to lose attendance or having to provide (embarrassing) explanations to justify our joining late. Sometimes we might even
totally forget about there being a class on a particular day/at a particular time.

Another big issue we face is to keep searching for the meeting joining link or credentials, so that we can log into the class meeting. This leads to a lot of hassle and confusion
which is quite unnecessary.

Using this simple app, all of these problems are resolved. We only have to provide our timetable schedule and the meeting link once, and the app will sort out the schedule in
chronological order, and will automatically alert you and join the meetings by launching the link at the time specified in the timetable. For classes that require a different link
for each session, a feature to automatically read the user's e-mails, to search for a particular subject pattern used by the meeting host for all their sessions and obtain the 
meeting link automatically and join the meeting, is being planned as of now.

The code is free for everyone to view, modidy, compile and/or re-distribute.

Thanks for reading!
